### More about me... 🇰🇷 🇹🇼 🇵🇭
- Hello! My actual name is Seunggyu 😋, but people call me Kim. Easier for you and hassel-free for me! 🤣
- I went to school in the Philippines and majored in Mathematics 🧮.
- My love ❤️ for languages and new cultures led me to Taiwan, where I studied Mandarin and worked at a local semiconductor equipment manufacturing company.
- Back in South Korea, I dove into the world of tech at Vanilla Coding Bootcamp, where I completed 6-months full stack web development coursework 🖥️.
- I'm currently looking for a junior-level web dev job 🙋🏻‍♂️, eager to bring my diverse background and newly acquired skills to the tech industry!
- Now, tell me about your story! 🙌
